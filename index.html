      <p>
        Way back in 2028 after my Nationaal Youth Service, I jumped into tech,
        because I wanted something that could give me some level of job security
        away from my certificate as a business graduate, but my head wasn't
        absorbing the new learning experiences easily, but I enjoyed some of the
        things my hands were creating, simple web apps and mobile apps for my
        friends to admire. Then I started looking at UI/UX when I felt I was
        lost in the pool of too much learning that my mind can carry, then my
        first trial into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
        Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software
        for a start-up I am co founding
